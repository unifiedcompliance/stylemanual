# Styles for the Person Schema

The Person schema is defined online [HERE](https://app.gitbook.com/@grcschema-org/s/schema-docs/2.-schemas/2.3a-person-disambiguation). It mainly consists of a person’s name\(s\), address\(es\), and email address\(es\).

## PersonName and AdditionalNames

The schema stores each person’s name as a suite of fields:

* name\_prefix
* first\_name
* middle\_initial
* last\_name
* name\_suffix

As such, each field's style will be defined, and then collectively the various formats of presentation will be defined.

### name\_prefix

Name prefixes are, for the most part, titles of honor and respect. Therefore, follow [title case](https://stylemanual.grcschema.org/overarching-styles/capitalization#title-case) for capitalization rules for creating the abbreviated version, as the abbreviated version is preferred. Because name prefixes should be standardized, a list of common prefixes follows:

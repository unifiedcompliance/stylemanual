# Language and Voice

### Use brevity of language. CC\_ID 06137

Brief, concise drafting usually leads to clear, understandable language. Clarity should not, how-ever, be sacrificed for the sake of brevity. Generally, short words are preferable to long words. Omit unnecessary words. If a word has the same meaning as a phrase, use the word. Use the shortest sentence that conveys the intended meaning.

### Define the use of voice in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06141

Use the active voice whenever possible. However, in rare instances, the passive voice may be used, such as when the subject of the sentence is the focus of some action to be implicitly taken by another person or organization. Example: Establish and maintain a policy regarding management of third party services.

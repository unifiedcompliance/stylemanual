# Define Number Formatting

In general, write out the numbers one through nine and use figures for 10 and above. Integers, dollar amounts, percentages, and fractions \(except dates, times, and numbers within the text of congressional bill digests or resolutions\) should be expressed in words followed by figures in parentheses.

### Define the use of the word one in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06121

When “one” is used as a pronoun, it should not be followed by a numeral in parentheses. Example:

* He was the only one to attend the meeting.

However, when “one” is used as a number, it should be followed by a numeral in parentheses. Example:

* The precinct shall nominate one \(1\) delegate.

### Define the styles for numbers expressed in words in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06117

Use Arabic numbers instead of words to express cardinal numbers. However, if words are to be used, then follow the word-expressed number with the cardinal number in parentheses. Examples:

* twenty-four \(24\)
* one hundred ten \(110\)
* eight hundred ninety-eight \(898\)
* one thousand six hundred fifty \(1,650\)
* eighty-four thousand \(84,000\)

Numbers may be expressed in figures, if their length would prohibit expressing them in both words and figures, especially in tables. Examples:

* County government share ..................... $15
* State government share ..........................$34

### Define the styles for ordinals in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06120

Always use Arabic numbers followed by the appropriate letters \(versus spelling out “first”, “second”, “third”, etc.\). You may italicize or superscript the letters following the Arabic numbers. Examples:

* 1st
* 2_nd_
* 3rd
* 180th

### Define the styles for fractions in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06118

Percentages are preferred to fractions whenever practicable.

| **Correct** | **Incorrect** |
| :--- | :--- |
| fifty percent \(50%\) | one-half \(1/2\) |
| seventy-five percent \(75%\) | three-fourths \(3/4\) |

Compound fractions should be expressed as follows:

* three and one-half \(3 1/2\)
* four and three-eighths \(4 3/8\)

### Define the styles for percentages in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06119

Decimals are preferred \(over fractions\) in the form of percentages whenever practicable. Examples:

* one-tenth of one percent \(0.1%\)
* sixty-two and one-half percent \(62.5%\)

### Define the styles for dates in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06122

Use figures for the number of years, except within quotations: 2 years or “It took him two years.”

When a date includes month, day, and year, the year is set off by commas, but when the date includes only the month and year, no comma is used. Examples:

* June 30; October 30, 1978, and the sentence continues…
* June 1984; April, May, and June 1985

### Define the styles for time in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06123

Generally, time should be expressed in figures. Avoid using terms such as “local time” and “prevailing local time”, and avoid referring to time zones, because compliance and governance content is not location specific. It is not necessary to use “midnight” as the expiration time for a term or license, because these will automatically expire at midnight, unless some other time is indicated. Examples:

* 6 a.m.; 4:30 p.m.
* midnight \(NOT 12:00 midnight\)
* noon \(NOT 12:00 noon\)

When referring to an activity required or permitted during a period after or before some stated event, use the word “not later than” in combination with “after” or “no earlier than” in combination with “before” instead of “within”.

| **Correct** | **Incorrect** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Not later than 30 days after X event | Within 30 days of X event |
| No earlier than 30 days before X event |  |

The “within” creates uncertainty about whether the activity is to precede or follow X event, or both.

### Define the styles for date and datetime fields.

Within the various database structures, both date fields and datetime fields are necessary. All fields that are associated with the database _must_ be added in Universal Time Code \(UTC\) format following ISO 8601 guidance, according to W3C guidelines found [HERE](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).

**Date fields** are formatted as 

| Format | Entry |
| :--- | :--- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | 1961-10-20 |

and

**Datetime fields** are formatted as 

| Format | Entry |
| :--- | :--- |
| YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss | 1961-10-20 05:47:32 |

Where

| Designator | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| YYYY | four-digit year |
| MM | two-digit month \(01=January, etc.\) |
| DD | two-digit day of month \(01 through 31\) |
| hh | two digits of hour \(00 through 23\) \(am/pm NOT allowed\) |
| mm | two digits of minute \(00 through 59\) |
| ss | two digits of second \(00 through 59\) |

### Define the styles for telephone number fields.

All telephone number fields will follow international [ITU-T E.164](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en) international phone number formatting of \[+\] \[country code\] \[area code\] \[local phone number\].  Where: 

**+** - plus sign 

**country code** - international country code 

**area code/national destination code** - code without leading 0 

**phone number** - local phone number 

Examples:

| Country | Local phone number | E.164 formatted number |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| USA | 415 123 1234 | +14151231234 |
| UK | 020 1234 1234 | +442012341234 |
| Lithuania | 8 601 12345 | +37060112345 |

### Define the styles for temperatures in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06124

Temperatures are expressed in words followed by figures in parentheses and then the measurement scale being used \(Fahrenheit or Celsius\). Examples:

* one hundred sixty \(160\) degrees Fahrenheit
* ninety \(90\) degrees Celsius

### Define the styles for money in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06125

Monetary amounts should be expressed as written words followed by a local currency sign and figures in parentheses. Dollar amounts that are whole do not need decimal points followed by zeroes. Examples:

* one dollar \($1\)
* ninety-seven dollars \($97\)
* two hundred dollars \($200\)
* three thousand five hundred dollars \($3,500\)

When expressing dollars and cents, use the word “and” and a decimal point to separate dollars and cents. Examples:

* eighty-five cents \($0.85\)
* five hundred twenty-five dollars and fifty cents \($525.50\)
* six hundred seventy-five thousand nine hundred eighty-two dollars and eleven cents \($675,982.11\)

### Define the styles for age in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06126

Use “at least,” “less than,” and “years of age” when referring to age. Examples:

* An applicant must be at least fifteen \(15\) years of age but less than eighteen \(18\) years of age.
* A person who is at least sixty-five \(65\) years of age is entitled to a pension.

### Define the styles for fiscal year in the sentence structure guidelines. CC\_ID 06127

When referring to the state fiscal year, use “beginning July 1” and “ending June 30”. Example:

* The appropriation covers the state fiscal year beginning July 1, 2000, and ending June 30, 2001.

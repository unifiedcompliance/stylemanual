# When to use Lowercase

Here are the rules when not to capitalize terms.

### Use lowercase for directional parts of states and directional parts of counties. CC\_ID 06178

Examples:

### Use lowercase for general designations of buildings. CC\_ID 06179

Examples:

* library in Fort Wayne \(but, the Fort Wayne Library\)
* the county courthouse
* the Indianapolis post offices

### Use lowercase for the words government or federal. CC\_ID 06180

This applies except when “federal” is a part of the name of the agency or statute\). However, use “United States” instead of “federal” when referring to a specific entity that does not have “federal” in the name. Always use the correct name of an agency. Examples:

* United States government;
* federal agencies \(but, Federal Bureau of Investigation\)

### Use lowercase for the name of any legislative body, judiciary body, administrative body or government department unless specifically instructed to capitalize them. CC\_ID 06181

This applies unless the name refers to a federal body, department, etc. Examples:

* Indiana general assembly;
* Indiana senate;
* department of state revenue;
* Congress of the United States;
* Supreme Court of the United States

### Use lowercase for official titles of state, official titles of county, or official titles of municipal officers, commissions, committees, or official titles of funds unless specifically instructed to capitalize them. CC\_ID 06182

Examples:

* clerk of the circuit court;
* board of county commissioners;
* public employees' retirement fund;

* state general fund

### Use lowercase for substitutes for official titles if a person's name is not used. CC\_ID 06183

Examples:

* the governor;
* the commissioner;
* the speaker of the house

### Use lowercase for references to laws on a particular subject. CC\_ID 06184
